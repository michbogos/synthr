# Synthr a minimal dependency digital synthethis library

Synthr uses a graph. It computes the value of the nodes on the fly to give maximum sonic range.

TODO:

- Add more filters.
- Add more oscillators.
- Integrate with GUI.
- Add effects.
- Make all node graph and polyphony ready.

For testing requires soundio.

``` bash
cmake # generate build files
make # make all
make synthr # make the static library
make program # make test program
```
